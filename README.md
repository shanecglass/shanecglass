- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shane!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in expanding access to open data and helping people make great data visualizations. I'm really passionate about helping folks get the most out of their data.
- You'll probably see me write SQL, Python, Terraform, and a little bit of everything else in my repos
- Find me on <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@shanecglass">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shanecglass.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/shanecglass">Twitter</a> for links to my latest work
