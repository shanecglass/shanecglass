- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shane!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in expanding access to open data and helping people make great data visualizations
- You'll probably see me write SQL, LookML, and some Python in my repos. I can't promise it'll be great, but I'm always happy to collaborate and learn more!
- Find me on <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@shanecglass">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/shanecglass">Twitter</a> for links to my latest work
